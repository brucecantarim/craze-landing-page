# craze-landing-page

This was a coding challenge that involved creating a landing page from a provided free psd template.
It's responsive, built using Webpack, Vue.js 2, Pug, Sass and lots of hot coffee mugs. 

All the code I've worked on can be found in the source folder.

You can check a live demo [here](http://crazepsdtheme.surge.sh/).
(Tested and working with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge)
